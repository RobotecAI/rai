# Turtlebot4 tutorial

Following tutorial will be presented during [ROSCon 2024](https://roscon.ros.org/2024/) talk about RAI.

## Recording

TBD

## Step by step instructions

1. O3DE simulation setup

   TBD

2. Clone and install [rai](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai)

   1. Follow setps from [1. Setting up the workspace](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai?tab=readme-ov-file#1-setting-up-the-workspace)
   2. Then follow steps from [2. Build the project](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai?tab=readme-ov-file#2-build-the-project)

3. Setup your [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/). Make sure you have set `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable.

4. Configure `rai_whoami_node` (based on ["Your robot identity in RAI"](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai/blob/development/docs/create_robots_whoami.md) tutorial):

   1. Create `whoami` package for turtlebot4 in `src/examples/turtlebot4`

      ```bash
      poetry run create_rai_ws --name turtlebot4 --destination-directory src/examples
      ```

   2. Download official turtlebot4 [data sheet](https://bit.ly/3KCp3Du) into
      `src/examples/turtlebot4_whoami/description/documentation`
   3. Download [image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.clearpathrobotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/16113604/Turtlebot-4-20220207.44.png) of turtlebot4 into `src/examples/turtlebot4_whoami/description/images`
   4. Run the `parse_whoami_package`. This will process the documentation, building
      it into a vector database, which is used by RAI agent to reason about its identity.

      > **NOTE**: Vector database is created using the OpenAI API. Parsing bigger documents
      > might lead to costs. Embedding model can be configured in
      > [config.toml](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai/blob/development/config.toml#L13)

      ```bash
      poetry run parse_whoami_package src/examples/turtlebot4_whoami/description
      ```

   5. Rebuild the workspace
      ```bash
      colcon build --symlink-install
      ```

   Congratulations! Your `rai_whoami_node` is configured. In the follwing steps
   your RAI agent will have turtlebot4 personality.

5. Run rai agent:

   ```bash
   ros launch ./src/examples/turtlebot4/turtlebot.launch.xml \
       game_launcher:=/path/to/simulation_binary/Turtlebot4.GameLauncher
   ```

6. Open you internet browser and go to `localhost:8501`
7. You can interact with your RAI agent through the chat. On the left you can interact
   with the RAI HMI Agent. On the right you will see status of missions that were send
   to the RAI Node and are executed on your robot.

   For example you can try:

   - Is it able to bring you something from the kitchen? (testing robot's identity)
   - What are its ros2 interfaces (discovery of ros2 interfaces)
   - tell me what you see (interpretation of camera image)
   - Drive towards the table (when table is not visible, robot rejects task that it cannot do)
   - Spin left by 90 degrees (interaction with the robot using ros2 interfaces) - table with the robotic are shoud be visible in the camera
   - Use robotic arm to pick up a box from the table (identity and intefaces doesn't allow it)
   - Drive towards the table (when table is visible, testing ability to interpret camera image and perform actions based on the knowledge)
   - Drive behind the table (likely will fail in current `rai` version due to limitations in spatial reasoning)

### Troubleshooting

_My robot doesn't have the identity._

1. Query `rai_whoami_node` for the identity manually

   ```bash
   ros2 service call /rai_whoami_identity_service std_srvs/srv/Trigger
   ```

2. Make sure you have all required files were generated correctly in the `turtlebot4_whoami` package and have simillar sizes.

   ```bash
   ls -sh src/examples/turtlebot4_whoami/description/
   total 52K
   4.0K documentation  4.0K images   28K index.faiss  8.0K index.pkl  4.0K robot_constitution.txt  4.0K robot_identity.txt
   ```

   You can also check the contents of `robot_indentify.txt` file (it is generated by LLM, but should be simillar to the one below).

   ```bash
   cat src/examples/turtlebot4_whoami/description/robot_identity.txt
   I am a TurtleBot® 4, a robotics learning platform designed for education and
   research in robotics. This next-generation mobile robot is built on the iRobot®
   Create® 3 mobile base and comes fully assembled with ROS 2 installed and configured,
   making it accessible for beginners and experienced developers alike.
   ...
   ```

   If files above are incorrect please check your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and rerun point 4
   of this tutorial.

_Robot doesn't move in the simulation._

1. Make sure you can see ros2 topic when simulation binary is running

   ```bash
   ros2 topic list
   ```
