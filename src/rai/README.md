## Project Directory Structure Overview

### Directory and File Descriptions

#### 🚀 `tools`

- **`ros`**: ROS oriented tools
- **`ros.cli`**: ros2 cli based tools
- **`other`**: Standard tools

#### 📡 `communication`

- **`communication.py`**: Here, standard communication protocols or methods that aren't specific to any particular platform should be implemented. This could involve REST API communications, handling standard input/output, etc.
- **`ros_communication.py`**: Originally designed for ROS2 communications, this file can be adapted to handle interactions with other real-time systems or complex multi-component software environments.

#### 📖 `history_saver.py`

- Houses the `HistorySaver` class, which is responsible for archiving interaction histories in HTML format.

#### 🎬 `scenario_engine`

- **`scenario_engine.py`**: Central to running predefined scenarios involving a series of actions and decisions. This file could be expanded with more complex decision-making capabilities or integrations with machine learning models for dynamic response generation.
