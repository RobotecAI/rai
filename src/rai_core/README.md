## RAI framework

-   [x] rai core: Core functionality for multi-agent system, human-robot interaction and
        multi-modalities.
-   [x] rai whoami: Tool to extract and synthesize robot embodiment information from a structured
        directory of documentation, images, and URDFs.
-   [x] rai_asr: Speech-to-text models and tools.
-   [x] rai_tts: Text-to-speech models and tools.
-   [x] rai_sim: Package for connecting RAI to simulation environments.
-   [x] rai_bench: Benchmarking suite for RAI. Test agents, models, tools, simulators, etc.
-   [x] rai_openset: Openset detection models and tools.
-   [x] rai_nomad: Integration with NoMaD for navigation.
-   [ ] rai_finetune: Finetune LLMs on your embodied data.

### Simulation demos

Try RAI yourself with these demos:
| Application | Robot | Description | Docs Link |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mission and obstacle reasoning in orchards | Autonomous tractor | In a beautiful scene of a virtual orchard, RAI goes beyond obstacle detection to analyze best course of action for a given unexpected situation. | [link](https://robotecai.github.io/rai/demos/agriculture/) |
| Manipulation tasks with natural language | Robot Arm (Franka Panda) | Complete flexible manipulation tasks thanks to RAI and Grounded SAM 2 | [link](https://robotecai.github.io/rai/demos/manipulation/) |
| Autonomous mobile robot demo | Husarion ROSbot XL | Demonstrate RAI's interaction with an autonomous mobile robot platform for navigation and control | [link](https://robotecai.github.io/rai/demos/rosbot_xl/) |
| Speech-to-speech interaction with autonomous taxi | Simulated car | Demonstrate RAI's speech-to-speech interaction capabilities for specifying destinations to an autonomous taxi in awsim with autoware environment | [link](https://robotecai.github.io/rai/demos/taxi/) |
