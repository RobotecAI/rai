# Welcome to RAI

**RAI** is an open-source framework that makes it easy to add AI-powered features—like natural language control and smart perception to your robots. It's designed to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and practical robotics applications, enabling developers to create more intelligent and accessible robotic systems.

Whether you're building industrial automation solutions, educational robots, or research prototypes, RAI provides the tools and infrastructure needed to bring advanced AI capabilities to your robotics projects. With its modular architecture and flexible integration options, RAI adapts to your needs while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## What is RAI?

-   It helps you control robots using natural language and advanced AI, making them more intuitive and accessible to use.
-   Works with popular robotics systems (like ROS 2), but can also be used on its own, giving you flexibility in how you integrate it.
-   Combines vision, speech, and sensor data to create comprehensive robotic understanding and control.

## How does RAI work?

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../imgs/rai_steps.png" width="80%" alt="rai-steps"></div>

RAI connects human instructions to robot actions in four simple steps:

-   Human gives a command: The user interacts with the robot using speech or text.
-   RAI understands and reasons: RAI interprets the request, plans the response, and decides on the best action.
-   RAI controls the robot: It sends commands to the robot through ROS 2 or the robot’s SDK.
-   Robot responds: The robot performs the action and can communicate back to the user, closing the loop.
