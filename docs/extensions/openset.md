Agents create two ROS 2 Nodes: `grounding_dino` and `grounded_sam` using [ROS2Connector](../../../docs/API_documentation/connectors/ROS_2_Connectors.md).
These agents can be triggered by ROS2 services:

-   `grounding_dino_classify`: `rai_interfaces/srv/RAIGroundingDino`
-   `grounded_sam_segment`: `rai_interfaces/srv/RAIGroundedSam`

> [!TIP]
>
> If you wish to integrate open-set vision into your ros2 launch file, a premade launch
> file can be found in `rai/src/rai_bringup/launch/openset.launch.py`

> [!NOTE]
> The weights will be downloaded to `~/.cache/rai` directory.

## RAI Tools

`rai_open_set_vision` package contains tools that can be used by [RAI LLM agents](../../../docs/tutorials/walkthrough.md)
enhance their perception capabilities. For more information on RAI Tools see
[Tool use and development](../tutorials/tools.md) tutorial.

> you can try example below with [rosbotxl demo](../demos/rosbot_xl.md) binary.
> The binary exposes `/camera/camera/color/image_raw` and `/camera/camera/depth/image_raw` topics.
