# Simulation and Benchmarking Overview

RAI provides a comprehensive framework for simulation and benchmarking that consists of two main components:

## RAI Sim

RAI Sim provides a simulator-agnostic interface that allows RAI to work with any simulation environment. It defines a standard interface (`SimulationBridge`) that abstracts the details of different simulators, enabling:

-   Consistent behavior across different simulation environments
-   Easy integration with new simulators
-   Seamless switching between simulation backends

The package provides also simulator bridges for concrete simulators, for now supporting only O3DE.
For detailed information about the simulation interface, see [RAI Sim Documentation](rai_sim.md).

## RAI Bench

RAI Bench provides benchmarks with ready to use tasks and a framework to create out own tasks. It enables:

-   Define and execute tasks
-   Measure and evaluate performance
-   Collect and analyze results

For detailed information about the benchmarking framework, see [RAI Bench Documentation](rai_bench.md).

## Integration

RAI Sim and RAI Bench work together to provide benchmarks which utilize simulations for evaluation:

1. **Simulation Interface**: RAI Sim provides the foundation with its simulator-agnostic interface
2. **Task Definition**: RAI Bench defines tasks that can be executed in any supported simulator
3. **Execution**: Tasks are executed through the simulation interface
4. **Evaluation**: Results are collected and analyzed using the benchmarking framework

This architecture allows for:

-   Flexible task definition independent of the simulator
-   Consistent evaluation across different simulation environments
-   Easy addition of new simulators and tasks
-   Comprehensive performance analysis

## Use Cases

The combined framework supports various use cases:

1. **Task Evaluation**: Testing and comparing different approaches to the same task
2. **Performance Analysis**: Measuring and analyzing system performance
3. **Development Testing**: Validating new features in simulation
4. **Research**: Conducting experiments in controlled environments

For specific implementation details and examples, refer to the respective documentation files.
