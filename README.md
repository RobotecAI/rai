## Overview

The RAI framework aims to:

- Supply a general multi-agent system, bringing Gen AI features to your robots.
- Add human interactivity, flexibility in problem-solving, and out-of-box AI features to existing robot stacks.
- Provide first-class support for multi-modalities, enabling interaction with various data types.
- Incorporate an advanced database for persistent agent memory.
- Include ROS 2-oriented tooling for agents.
- Support a comprehensive task/mission orchestrator.

## Features

- [x] Voice interaction (both ways).
- [x] Customizable robot identity, including constitution (ethical code) and documentation (understanding own capabilities).
- [x] Accessing camera ("What do you see?") sensor, utilizing VLMs.
- [x] Reasoning about its own state through ROS logs.
- [x] ROS 2 action calling and other interfaces. The Agent can dynamically list interfaces, check their message type, and publish.
- [x] Integration with LangChain to abstract vendors and access convenient AI tools.
- [x] Tasks in natural language to nav2 goals.
- [ ] NoMaD integration.
- [ ] OpenVLA integration.
- [ ] Improved Human-Robot Interaction with voice and text.
- [ ] SDK for RAI developers.
- [ ] Support for at least 3 different AI vendors.
- [ ] Additional tooling such as GroundingDino.
- [ ] UI for configuration to select features and tools relevant for your deployment.

# Quick Start

Currently, RAI supports Ubuntu 24.04 with ROS 2 Jazzy and Python 3.12.
The release will also support Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble (it should work or be close to working now).

### 1. Setting up the workspace:

#### 1.1 Install poetry

Install poetry (1.8+) with the following line, or

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

by following the official [docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

#### 1.2 Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai.git
cd rai
```

#### 1.3 Create poetry virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

### 2. Build the project:

#### 2.1 Build RAI workspace

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

#### 2.2 Activate a virtual environment:

```bash
source ./setup_shell.sh
```

### 3. Setting up vendors

RAI is fully vendor-agnostic, however the beta development work currently utilizes OpenAI models. Setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable will yield the best results.

#### OpenAI

If you do not have a key, see how to generate one [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart).

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

#### Congratulations, your installation is now complete!

# Running RAI

RAI is a sophisticated framework targeted at solving near general cases. As of now, we provide the following examples:

1. Engage with your ROS 2 network through an intuitive Streamlit chat interface.
2. Explore the O3DE Husarion ROSbot XL demo and assign tasks via natural language.

If you are more ambitious:

- Create your own robot description package and unleash it with the rai_whoami node.
- Run Streamlit powered by your custom robotâ€™s description package and effortlessly access your robot's documentation as well as identity and constitution.
- Implement additional tools via LangChain's @tool and use them in your chat.

## 1. Chat Interface

Chat seamlessly with your setup, retrieve images from cameras, adjust parameters on the fly, and get comprehensive information about your topics.

```bash
streamlit run src/rai_hmi/rai_hmi/streamlit_hmi_node.py
```

Remember to run this command in a sourced shell.

## 2. O3DE Rosbot XL Demo

This demo provides a practical way to interact with and control a virtual Husarion ROSbot XL within a simulated environment.
Using natural language commands, you can assign tasks to the robot, allowing it to perform a variety of actions.

Given that this is a beta release, consider this demo as an opportunity to explore the framework's capabilities, provide feedback, and contribute.
Try different commands, see how the robot responds, and use this experience to understand the potential and limitations of the system.

# Planned demos

- [agriculture demo ðŸŒ¾](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai-agriculture-demo)
- [rosbot xl demo demo ðŸ¤–](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai-rosbot-xl-demo)
- [manipulation demo ðŸ¦¾](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai-manipulation-demo)
- Quadruped inspection demo

## Manipulation demo

We are actively working on integrating RAI with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to further extend the generalization capabilities of RAI. The upcoming manipulation demo will showcase a practical use case where a single prompt can be used to instruct a robotic arm to perform a series of specific tasks. For more details about our plans and ongoing work related to the integration and fine-tuning of VLA models, please refer to [manipulation.md](docs/manipulation.md).
