# Contributing

We are very happy you want to contribute to RAI, and we welcome all input.
This document outlines guidelines for contributors to follow.

Our philosophy is strongly aligned with the philosophy of the ROS development process.
These guidelines have been therefore strongly influenced by the [ROS2 Contributing document](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing.html).

## Tenets

 - Engage Robotec.ai as early as possible
    - Start discussions with Robotec.ai and the community early. Long time RAI contributors may have a clearer vision of the big picture. If you implement a feature and send a pull request without discussing with the community first, you are taking the risk of it being rejected, or you may be asked to largely rethink your design.
    - Opening issues or using Discourse to socialize an idea before starting the implementation is generally preferable.

 - Adopt community best-practices whenever possible instead of ad-hoc processes

    Think about the end-users experiance when developing and contributing. Features accessible to a larger amount of potential users, utilising widely available solutions are more likely to be accepted.

 - Think about the community as a whole
    
    Think about the bigger picture. There are developers building different robots with different constraints. The landscape of available AI models is rapidly changing, coming with different capabilities and constraints. RAI wants to accomodate requirements of the whole community.

There are a number of ways you can contribute to the RAI project.
